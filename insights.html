    <h1>real-time data ingestion from MySQL to Power BI</h1>
    <p>We used AWS
Database Migration Service (DMS) to replicate our MySQL database to an Amazon Aurora instance in
near real-time. This handled the load without impacting the production database. Next, we set up
AWS Data Pipeline to transform and aggregate data into a star schema optimized for analytics. The
processed data was then loaded into Amazon Redshift, which Power BI could query directly using its
optimized connector. We also used AWS CloudWatch to monitor replication lag and query
performance.</p>
<h1>insights</h1>
<p>
"In Power BI, we focused on actionable insights. For individual students, we had 'learning path'
flowcharts showing topic progressions and highlighting bottlenecks. Heatmaps displayed time
distribution across subjects, revealing neglected areas. For instructors, we had classroom-level
dashboards with engagement metrics, topic mastery bell curves, and predictive charts showing atrisk students. We used lots of conditional formatting, like red-yellow-green scales for performance.
The most loved feature was the 'concept cloud,' where size represented difficulty and color showed
mastery level.</p>
