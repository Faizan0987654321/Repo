    <h1>AWS Services</h1>

    <P>Our AWS architecture for the Gen AI system was comprehensive. We used Amazon Lex for the
        conversational interface, allowing IT staff to interact with the system via voice or text. Incoming
        queries were processed by Lex and sent to a Lambda function, which orchestrated the workflow. For
        heavy lifting, we used SageMaker to host our fine-tuned Megatron-LM model, leveraging its
        automatic scaling. Historical tickets and model checkpoints were stored in S3 for durability. We used
        Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) to store structured data like incident categories, user feedback, and
        application logs. EC2 instances handled web services and real-time analytics.</P>

    <h2>AWS Lex</h2>
    <p>Developed conversational AI chatbots using AWS Lex to automate customer service and support processes, integrating with backend systems for data retrieval and updates.</p>
    
    <h2>AWS SageMaker</h2>
    <p>Trained and deployed machine learning models, including the anomaly detection and recommendation engines, using SageMaker's managed infrastructure and integrated tools for data processing, model training, and hosting.</p>
    
    <h2>AWS EC2</h2>
    <p>Provisioned and managed compute instances (EC2) to run resource-intensive workloads, such as distributed model training, data processing pipelines, and containerized application deployments.</p>
    
    <h2>AWS S3</h2>
    <p>Utilized S3 (Simple Storage Service) as a secure and scalable data lake to store and retrieve large volumes of structured and unstructured data required for model training and inference.</p>
    
    <h2>AWS RDS</h2>
    
    <p>Employed RDS (Relational Database Service) to set up and manage relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL for storing and querying student data, course materials, and other application data.</p>
    
    <h2>AWS Lambda</h2>
    <p>Implemented serverless functions using AWS Lambda to build event-driven architectures, such as real-time data processing pipelines, API gateways, and integrating various AWS services.</p>
    
    <h2>AWS API Gateway</h2>
    <p>Created and managed RESTful APIs using API Gateway, acting as an entry point for client applications to interact with backend services like machine learning models and databases.</p>
    
    <h2>AWS CloudWatch</h2>
    <p>Monitored and analyzed application performance, resource utilization, and system health using CloudWatch's log aggregation, metrics collection, and alerting capabilities.</p>
    
    <h2>AWS IAM</h2>
    <p>Implemented robust access controls and permissions management using AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) to ensure secure access to resources and services across different environments.</p>
